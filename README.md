# HR-Analysis
üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes Employee Attrition data to understand the factors behind employee turnover and provide actionable recommendations.
The dataset contains information about employees‚Äô demographics, work environment, salaries, promotions, and job satisfaction.
By analyzing this data, we aim to identify the main reasons employees leave the company and how to reduce attrition rates while improving productivity and employee satisfaction.

üîç Key Insights

From the analysis, I found the following insights:

Total Attrition:

237 employees left the company, which is a significant number.

Salary Factor:

Around 80% of employees who left had salaries below the average in their department.

Specifically, 100% of Laboratory Technicians in Research & Development had salaries below the department‚Äôs average.

The total cost of attrition (sum of salaries of employees who left) is 1M, which leads to high costs in both money and productivity.

Overtime Factor:

46% of employees who left were working overtime, which indicates understaffing and a need for additional hiring, especially in the Sales department.

Work Environment:

30% of employees who left had low environment satisfaction, which suggests workplace issues.

Job Satisfaction:

28% of attrition cases were due to dissatisfaction with the job itself.

Distance From Home:

19% of employees who left had long commuting distances, which might be a secondary factor for attrition.

Promotion Factor:

112 employees had not received a promotion in 7 years, which strongly contributed to attrition.

Age Factor:

Out of those 112 employees, most were aged 25‚Äì35, which shows that young employees are leaving due to lack of career growth opportunities.

‚úÖ Recommendations

Based on these findings, I recommend:

Salary Adjustments

Increase salaries for employees below the departmental average, especially Laboratory Technicians in Research & Development.

Compare the cost of attrition (1M) with the cost of raising salaries; investing in salaries is more cost-effective.

Training & Development

Provide at least 5 training programs per year to improve skills and engagement.

Workload Management

Reduce excessive overtime by hiring more staff, especially in Sales.

Improve Work Environment

Address workplace issues that lead to low environment satisfaction.

Conduct surveys to identify the key concerns.

Career Growth Opportunities

Implement clear promotion paths.

Ensure employees, especially those aged 25‚Äì35, see growth opportunities to reduce attrition.

Support for Commuting Employees

Provide transportation support or remote work options for employees living far from the office.
